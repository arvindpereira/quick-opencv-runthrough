quick-opencv-runthrough
=======================

A simple repository where I'm just running through the official OpenCV tutorials. 
This repository will ensure that it is easy to build those examples very easily.

OpenCV can be found here:
http://opencv.org

On a Mac, use Homebrew to install pkg-config, automake etc after Xcode Tools.
